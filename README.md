## Safe Use of Context
A short talk given on Split.JS meetup in Split, November 23, 2017.

Context API is one part of React that is usually avoided by developers.
That is understandable since the whole of the Internet suggests against using it.
Even the official React docs make you want to avoid the context API.
Regardless, context is a powerful tool and it can greatly help us in solving certain kinds of problems.
In this talk we'll identify some of those problems and propose a way of using context while mitigating its deficiencies.
